Revision history for Devel-Hook.

0.004   Sun Mar  2 2008
        - support manipulating array of UNITCHECK blocks
          (for Perls that have it)
        - new test for bad block arguments
        - no actual need for ppport.h (considering API
          for 5.006+ Perls)

0.003   Sat Mar  1 2008
        - enable prototypes in Hook.xs
        - it is useless to try to support 5.005
          (big API changed introduced by 5.006 seems
          to have changed a lot of things)
        - perl minimum version is 5.006

0.002   Sat Mar  1 2008
        - fixed mistake and omissions in Makefile.PL
        - no 'our' for 5.005's sake
        - require warnings::compat (if < 5.006)
        - POD and POD coverage tests
        - (will it be enough to build/test/install in 5.005?)
